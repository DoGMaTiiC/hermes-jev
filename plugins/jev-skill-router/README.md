# jev-skill-router

[TypeSafe Jev](https://docs.typesafe.ai) (System One) as a skill router for
Hermes Agent: before the model call, Jev names **at most one** skill from the
live roster for the current turn, and the plugin injects a single
`<skill_relevance>` line into the user-message context. It says nothing when
nothing fits. Two routes, picked by the `backend` setting (`auto` by
default: `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` wins, else `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY`) — pure stdlib,
no Node, no SDK.

| Route | Endpoint | Key | Questions | Confidence | Cost |
| ----- | -------- | --- | --------- | ---------- | ---- |
| TypeSafe direto | `POST https://api.typesafe.ai/v1/systemone` (`model: jev-latest`) | `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` | `noul` / `choice` / `score` | inline per answer | none (`usage` in tokens) |
| Vercel AI Gateway | `POST {jev_base_url}/evaluation-model` (`typesafe-ai/jev`) | `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` | `boolean` / `choice` / `score` | `providerMetadata.typesafe.confidence` | `providerMetadata.gateway.cost` |

Yes/no questions are `boolean` internally and mapped to `noul` on the
TypeSafe wire; answers come back normalized.

Rota TypeSafe implementada conforme a doc; ainda não exercitada ao vivo (sem chave disponível).

## What it does

**Hook** (`pre_llm_call`, opt-in): two Jev requests per eligible turn.
Request 1 ranks the whole roster with one Choice plus three gate booleans
(does this turn want a skill at all — the third one inverted). Request 2
re-reads the top three with each candidate's SKILL.md excerpt plus one
absolute `fits` judgment per candidate. Two thresholds, at most one skill
name back. The model stays in charge: the line says to ignore it when it
does not fit.

Rosters above the API's 255-choice cap are chunked (240 per chunk, each with
a `none_of_these` option). Slash commands, empty messages, long pastes and
already-routed turns are left alone.

## Install

```bash
hermes plugins install DoGMaTiiC/hermes-jev-skill-router
hermes jev-skill-router auto   # or: on
```

Requires `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` (direct) and/or `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` (Vercel AI
Gateway key) and Hermes ≥ 0.21. No key at all: the plugin loads and stays
silent.

## Settings

`plugins.entries.jev-skill-router.settings` in `config.yaml`:

| `fits`          | `0.40`                                     | Winner's own "does it fit" judgment; below it, silence |

## What leaves your machine

Per eligible turn: the request text plus skill names and one-line
descriptions; for the 3 shortlisted candidates, the description plus the
first 700 characters of SKILL.md. Never: conversation history, files,
memory, or tool output.

## Cost / latency

About 2 Jev calls per eligible turn — roughly $0.00002 on the gateway
(TypeSafe direto bills in tokens, no per-call $) and ~1 s. Ineligible
turns (slash, empty, long, already routed) and `mode: off` cost nothing.

## Fail-open, always

Missing key for the selected backend, timeout, HTTP error, malformed body —
the hook returns nothing and the turn proceeds exactly as today.

## Under rate limit

The gateway free tier limits per model; TypeSafe direto has no gateway
limiter. On 429/529 the client reads `Retry-After` (seconds or HTTP date;
garbage and non-finite values like `nan`/`inf` are ignored) and retries
**once** if the wait fits in `retry_max_wait_s` (2.0s) — never in a loop.
After `breaker_threshold` (3) consecutive 429/529s the endpoint goes silent
for `breaker_cooldown_s` (120s); any success resets the count. The breaker
counts one rate-limit event per call, even when the retry is limited too.
Outgoing calls are spaced `min_interval_s` (0.25s) apart per process, and
identical calls share one cached answer for `cache_seconds` (300s).

Wall-clock budget: `timeout_s` bounds each attempt, so one call with a
retry can take up to ~2×`timeout_s` + `retry_max_wait_s` (~10s at defaults).
