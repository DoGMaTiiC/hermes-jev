"""Two-stage skill router — the TypeSafe "skill suggestion" cookbook, over the gateway.

Request 1 ranks the whole roster with one Choice and scores the request with three
booleans (a gate: does this turn want a skill at all?). Request 2 re-reads the top
three with each candidate's own SKILL.md excerpt plus one absolute `fits` judgment
per candidate. Two requests, two thresholds, at most one skill name back.

Question text, state shape and thresholds follow the published cookbook
(docs.typesafe.ai/cookbooks/skill_suggestion) so upstream changes can be diffed.
